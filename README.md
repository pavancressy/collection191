The biggest challenge for this project was the final step after the letters of the word had been checked to detect if the word was a palindrome. At this stage, I didn't know how to use this information to check mathematically if the word was a palindrome. This was my solution: I totaled up all the letter matches, and if the number of matches equaled 1/2 of the length of the word, then the word was a palindrome.
